## The Espresso-Shot Scorecard ☕

| Topic | Labor | LNP | Greens | Minors (ON, KAP, etc.) |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|------------------------|
| **Housing** | $10 bn Housing Australia Future Fund; *Help to Buy* shared equity | Kill stamp duty on new builds for first-home buyers; five-year mortgage-interest deductions | Two-year rent freeze, then 1 % cap; 100 000 public homes/yr | Bigger first-home grants; oppose rent caps |
| **Transport** | Lock in 50-cent fares; finish Metro extension to UQ | **Rename** Cross River Rail “Elizabeth Line”; push Sunshine Coast rail; widen Bruce Hwy | Free public transport by 2026; flood-proof bikeways | More roads, fewer rails |
| **Energy & Climate** | 82 % renewables by 2030; grid ‘rewiring’ | SMRs (small modular reactors) + new gas; net-zero “one day” | 100 % renewables by 2030; kill new coal & gas | Keep coal burning, hike royalties |
| **Cost of Living** | Tweak stage-three tax cuts, GP bulk-billing boost, power rebates | Halve fuel excise, scrap Labor tax cuts, nuclear “cheap power” | Billionaire tax → free dental & mental Medicare, rent caps | Royalties-funded regional rebates |
| **Jobs & Industry** | Clean-tech hubs in Archerfield & Redbank | ‘Fresh Start’ 100-day red-tape bonfire | Jobs guarantee building homes & solar | More dams, more tradie apprentices |

## Housing: Who’ll Rescue the Share-house Sofa?

* **Labor** is betting on supply: 30 000 social and affordable homes in five years via the $10 bn Housing Australia Future Fund, plus *Help to Buy* that sees the gov’t own up to 40 % of your lounge room.  [Australian Labor Party](https://alp.org.au/affordable_housing_commitment)  
  *Upside:* genuine new stock, easier deposits.  
  *Downside:* Qld’s wait-list is 45 000 deep—maths says some Brisbanites still crash on mates’ couches.

* **LNP** wants demand boosters: zero stamp duty on new builds and mortgage-interest write-offs for five years.  [Log in or sign up to view](https://www.facebook.com/DavidCrisafulliMP/posts/weve-removed-stamp-duty-on-all-new-homes-for-every-first-home-buyer/1047319357210562/)  
  *Upside:* could save ~$29 k on an $800 k townhouse.  
  *Downside:* academic economists call it “chucking avocado oil on the auction fire”.

* **Greens** flip the script: freeze rents two years, cap rises at 1 % after, fund public builds Woodford-Festival-scale.  [The Australian Greens](https://greens.org.au/campaigns/rent-freeze-now)  
  *Upside:* West End renters finally exhale.  
  *Downside:* constitutional barney with states; landlords threatening to Airbnb everything from Ashgrove to Yeronga.

### Hidden Angle – *Floodplain Factor*  
None of the big parties talk much about climate-adapted housing. With Oxley Creek still soggy from 2022, look for developers favouring higher ground (hello, Toowong ridges) no matter who wins.

## Transport: From Chermside to Woolloongabba Without Tears

* **Labor**’s 50-cent fares are already reality, sending weekend patronage up 80 %.  [Translink](https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/50-cent-fares)  
* **LNP** promises the same cheap ticket but wants a royal rebrand: Cross River Rail → “Elizabeth Line”.  [ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-13/lnp-to-rename-cross-river-rail-elizabeth-line/103834810)  
* **Greens** call fares “so 2024” and plan to scrap them entirely by 2026, costed at $390 m/yr.  [AAP News](https://aapnews.aap.com.au/news/greens-free-public-transport-proposal-a-fantasy)  

| Party | Why It Rocks | Mind the Gap |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Labor | Already budgeted; helps Struggle-Street commuters | Trial ends in 2026—then what? |
| LNP | Keeps cheap fares *and* throws cash at Bruce Hwy | Renaming a tunnel doesn’t add trains; gridlock risk if roads dominate |
| Greens | Free fares + 24/7 high-freq buses could bust congestion | $390 m revenue hole means a new levy (developers, say the Greens) |

### Sneaky Angle – *Olympic Timetable*  
The 2032 Games need 75 % of spectators on mass transit. Free fares (Greens) or 50-cent (everyone else) may stay simply to dodge IOC side-eye.

## Energy & Climate: Sunshine State vs Fission State

* **Labor** → 82 % renewables by 2030, powered by Queensland’s mega-sun and mega-wind; “Rewiring the Nation” cash for new interconnectors.  
* **LNP** → loves a buzzword: small modular reactors (SMRs) as baseload, plus new gas fields.  [World Nuclear News](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/energy-in-spotlight-as-australian-election-campaigns-begin)  
* **Greens** → quit fossil fuels by 2030, ban new coal & gas, shut down Adani (again).  

### Quirky Angle – *Nuke Tourism?*  
If SMRs pop up near Gympie, expect grey-nomad selfie spots that make the Big Pineapple look tame. But they won’t switch on till 2035 at best, so don’t bin your PV panels yet.

## Cost-of-Living Sweeteners

* **Labor**: re-tuned tax cuts, bulk-billing rescue cash, and another round of power bill rebates.  
* **LNP**: 12 c-a-litre fuel excise cut—handy if you’re forever stuck on M1 roadworks.  [ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-27/peter-dutton-fuel-excise-cut-explained/105102732)  
* **Greens**: slug billionaires, plug the money into *Medicare-But-With-Teeth* and rent caps.

### Hidden Angle – *University Car-parks*  
Cheaper petrol might spike UQ and QUT parking demand. Could the next policy frontier be “free e-scooter chargers”? Watch this space.

---

## Jobs & Industry: From Fish-n-Chip Fridays to Deep-tech Mondays

* **Labor** spruiks clean-tech manufacturing precincts at Archerfield and Redbank—think batteries built where B-52s once snoozed.  
* **LNP**’s 100-day “Fresh Start” cuts red tape; small-biz stamp-duty relief aims to keep Microbrewery Mile bubbling.  
* **Greens** promise a jobs guarantee erecting solar farms and public housing—tradie heaven if materials hold up.

### Niche Angle – *Cyber Security*  
Labor’s pitch includes a National Cyber HQ; Brisbane’s rapidly growing Fortitude Valley tech scene could score government contracts for everything from Olympic ticketing security to AI-based flood alerts.

## Coal Royalties – The Sleeper Issue

Progressive coal royalties pulled in $9.4 bn extra over two years. Labor locked them in with “Hands off, Crisafulli” legislation.  [Ministerial Media Statements](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/101332)  
*Miners cry foul, regional councils cheer stadium refurb cash.*  
The LNP hasn’t said it’ll scrap the tiers—but its backbench is itching. Keep an eye on Rocky and Mackay seats; royalties could swing them.

## Verdict: Who Gets Your Democracy Sausage?

| You Are… | You Might Fancy… | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Inner-city renter, two bikes, one rescued greyhound | **Greens** | Rent freeze + free buses |
| Tradie couple itching for first home at North Lakes | **LNP** | Bye-bye stamp duty; cheap servo runs |
| Family juggling GP visits & power bills in Moorooka | **Labor** | Bulk-billing boost + renewables = lower leccy |
| Bowen Basin diesel-ute driver | **KAP / One Nation** | Royalties rebates, more dams, fewer net-zero lectures |

## Final Whistle

Elections in Brissie are like summer storms—steamy build-up, one almighty clap, then half the city forgets to put the wheelie-bins out. Whatever colour wins on 3 May, remember:

* Snag the free sausage.  
* Vote below the line if you like colouring in.  
* Pack an umbrella—the only thing less predictable than polling booths is Queensland weather.

*PS: If any policy actually delivers a four-minute Chermside-to-GABBA commute, we’ll shout the first round at Felons.*
