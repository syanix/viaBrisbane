Mandalas have a rich history in Persian art and architecture. Sara is drawn to the significance of these symbols in her own life, but also their resonance across other cultures and spiritualities. During her residency, she will engage with various Brisbane communities to create a series of collaborative mandalas. Over several months, these works will be added to the MoB entrance as an evolving installation.

Fortitude Valley
It’s gritty, raw and cosmopolitan. This is Australia’s first dedicated entertainment precinct. From grungy pubs to designer decor, the Valley is expressive. The Valley reveals a fascinating story that saw it rise as a commercial and retail centre in the late 19th century, the important contributions made by the Chinese community, the emergence of the Valley as the centre for Brisbane’s gay community, and the Valley’s role in the infamous Fitzgerald Inquiry.

Come with us on a journey through the history and events that have shaped Fortitude Valley into what it is today.

Celebrate the Year of the Snake at Lunar New Year in the Valley. Book now to secure a spot at your favourite Asian restaurants and then enjoy free, live entertainment and cultural markets throughout Chinatown Mall and the Fortitude Valley precinct on Saturday 1 and Sunday 2 February.
