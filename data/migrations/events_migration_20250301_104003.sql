Now, Houston, Texas psych-funk trio Khruangbin return to Australia next summer with shows in Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney in February/March 2025 as part of their global A LA SALA tour.

Having recently wowed fans at European festivals such as Rock Werchter and Roskilde, bassist Laura Lee Ochoa, drummer Donald ‘DJ’ Johnson, Jr., and guitarist Mark ‘Marko’ Speer will return to Australia to celebrate their first album in four years: A LA SALA (“To the room” in Spanish). If 2020’s Mordechai was a party record that enhanced the band’s musical reputation, A LA SALA is the measured morning after. A gorgeously airy album made with minimal overdubs, A LA SALA scales Khruangbin down to scale up, a creative strategy with the future in mind.

Khruangbin launched the A LA SALA tour in April at Coachella, with sold out shows across US/Canada in May/June. With festival sets at Nos Alive (Lisbon), Latitude (Suffolk), Bilbao BBK (Spain) and Bonnaroo (US) on the itinerary, and European/UK dates in November, Khruangbin return to Australia in early 2025 for what promises to be some of the hottest shows this summer.

Joining Khruangbin as special guest at all shows and making their debut trip to Australia is acclaimed two-piece Hermanos Gutiérrez, the instrumental guitar duo of Swiss/Ecuadorian brothers Alejandro and Estevan Gutiérrez. The pair’s new album, Sonido Cósmico,  was released in June and produced by Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys). Brimming with Latin mystique and otherworldly guitar interplay that “shimmers with hallucinogenic energy” (Rolling Stone), the album is an odyssey through lush musical soundscapes, as heard on lead single ‘Barrio Hustle’.', 'Brisbane City Council', 'Featured,Music', NULL, 'Music', 'Priced ticketed event', 'https://www.trumba.com/i/DgDY4QBPVAdCWJc9xC3y85Ur.jpg', 'Suitable for all ages', 'Tickets can be purchased <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com.au/khruangbin-brisbane-02-03-2025/event/130060FDA8F157C2" target="_blank">Ticketmaster</a>.', TRUE, NULL, 'Riverstage, Brisbane City', 'Riverstage, Gardens Point Road, Brisbane City', 'General Council venue', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '176571964');

A show of war lost and won!

The prophets who once hailed Macbeth, foretelling his rise to power, have lingered in the shadows for too long. Now, the Weird Sisters step out from the wings and take centre stage.

In this reimagining of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Witches—whose cryptic prophecies drive Macbeth to murder, madness, and ruin—become the focus. Their deep spiritual and philosophical connection to the Earth reveals a world groaning under the weight of human ambition. Through their eyes, we see not just Macbeth’s bloody climb to the throne, but the profound consequences of our insatiable desire for power.

In this innovative production, the Weird Sisters are no longer mere bystanders. They embody the forces of nature itself, their voices intertwined with the Earth’s cries for balance and need for healing. Blending dance, movement, text and sound, this hybrid performance explores the interconnectedness of all things—reminding us that every action we take ripples through the natural world.

Co-directed by La Boite Theatre’s Artistic Director Courtney Stewart and Lisa Fa’alafi (Co-Artistic Director Polytoxic, Hot Brown Honey), with a dynamic local cast, this production also welcomes back the formidable Sue Rider, former Artistic Director of La Boite, as dramaturg.

Opening on International Women’s Day, experience a bold new take on one of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies in this daring reimagining of Macbeth.

On Buzz, her songwriting remains as intimate as ever. In her initial sketches of songs for Buzz, NIKI took cues from other lane-paving women with confessional, honest lyricism soundtracked by guitars. “Joni Mitchell is my songwriting north star,” she says — and uncompromising feminist luminaries like Stevie Nicks, Carly Simon and Liz Phair. To match the wandering spirit of Buzz, NIKI cultivated her own elastic approach to guitar.

For NIKI, things have been happening progressively since she was a high schooler in Jakarta, Indonesia. As a student at an international academy, she cut her teeth scribbling lovesick poems in English class and performed acoustic guitar covers of American pop songs on YouTube. With a six-string in hand, and her family and classmates cheering her on from the audience, Nicole Zefanya then staked her claim to global stardom as NIKI.

And claim it she has - with over three billion streams worldwide, sold out shows on multiple continents, massive sets at festivals across the globe, front row seats at Paris Fashion Week, four songs on a Marvel film’s soundtrack, and some of the most phenomenal, confessional songs being released in 2024, NIKI has already established a veteran’s resume before the age of 25. Buzz reverberates with the hard-earned wisdom of a young woman who charges dauntlessly towards her dreams - but can still spare a laugh if she stumbles.', 'Brisbane City Council', 'Music', NULL, 'Music', 'Priced ticketed event', 'https://www.trumba.com/i/DgBirISYyYsWFCihh3MspKvj.jpg', 'Suitable for all ages', '***Event has been relocated***

In an unprecedented collaboration, Australasian Dance Collective (ADC) and Urban Art Projects (UAP) invite you to experience art as never before, in a site-specific dance theatre creation that defies the boundaries between performance and visual art.

Crafted for the imposing UAP Foundry, Relic explores the interplay of mortality, fragility, youth and spirit. Inspired by the timeless themes of 16th and 17th-century still life paintings and the haunting symbolism of the memento mori movement, Relic reimagines these age-old notions of mortality through the fearless spirit of motocross - helmets for skulls, smoking rubber for snuffed-out candles, and the inevitable heralding of the final lap for the sands in the hourglass.

A show of war lost and won!

The prophets who once hailed Macbeth, foretelling his rise to power, have lingered in the shadows for too long. Now, the Weird Sisters step out from the wings and take centre stage.

In this reimagining of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Witches—whose cryptic prophecies drive Macbeth to murder, madness, and ruin—become the focus. Their deep spiritual and philosophical connection to the Earth reveals a world groaning under the weight of human ambition. Through their eyes, we see not just Macbeth’s bloody climb to the throne, but the profound consequences of our insatiable desire for power.

In this innovative production, the Weird Sisters are no longer mere bystanders. They embody the forces of nature itself, their voices intertwined with the Earth’s cries for balance and need for healing. Blending dance, movement, text and sound, this hybrid performance explores the interconnectedness of all things—reminding us that every action we take ripples through the natural world.

Co-directed by La Boite Theatre’s Artistic Director Courtney Stewart and Lisa Fa’alafi (Co-Artistic Director Polytoxic, Hot Brown Honey), with a dynamic local cast, this production also welcomes back the formidable Sue Rider, former Artistic Director of La Boite, as dramaturg.

Opening on International Women’s Day, experience a bold new take on one of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies in this daring reimagining of Macbeth.

In an unprecedented collaboration, Australasian Dance Collective (ADC) and Urban Art Projects (UAP) invite you to experience art as never before, in a site-specific dance theatre creation that defies the boundaries between performance and visual art.

Crafted for the imposing UAP Foundry, Relic explores the interplay of mortality, fragility, youth and spirit. Inspired by the timeless themes of 16th and 17th-century still life paintings and the haunting symbolism of the memento mori movement, Relic reimagines these age-old notions of mortality through the fearless spirit of motocross - helmets for skulls, smoking rubber for snuffed-out candles, and the inevitable heralding of the final lap for the sands in the hourglass.

A show of war lost and won!

The prophets who once hailed Macbeth, foretelling his rise to power, have lingered in the shadows for too long. Now, the Weird Sisters step out from the wings and take centre stage.

In this reimagining of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Witches—whose cryptic prophecies drive Macbeth to murder, madness, and ruin—become the focus. Their deep spiritual and philosophical connection to the Earth reveals a world groaning under the weight of human ambition. Through their eyes, we see not just Macbeth’s bloody climb to the throne, but the profound consequences of our insatiable desire for power.

In this innovative production, the Weird Sisters are no longer mere bystanders. They embody the forces of nature itself, their voices intertwined with the Earth’s cries for balance and need for healing. Blending dance, movement, text and sound, this hybrid performance explores the interconnectedness of all things—reminding us that every action we take ripples through the natural world.

Co-directed by La Boite Theatre’s Artistic Director Courtney Stewart and Lisa Fa’alafi (Co-Artistic Director Polytoxic, Hot Brown Honey), with a dynamic local cast, this production also welcomes back the formidable Sue Rider, former Artistic Director of La Boite, as dramaturg.

Opening on International Women’s Day, experience a bold new take on one of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies in this daring reimagining of Macbeth.

Presented by special guest speaker Natalie Merryman, this talk will delve into the reforms and policy changes that have opened possibilities for women in the ADF, the accomplishments of contemporary ADF women, and the lack of real recognition of women as veterans in the community. Natalie will discuss her research project and findings to illustrate why this is, what the consequences are, and what needs to change to address the issue.

Natalie Merryman is a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Newcastle, focusing on the gendered experiences of women veterans in the Australian Defence Force (ADF). A military veteran herself, Natalie brings a wealth of practical experience to her research having worked as a Registered Nurse and a volunteer Military Compensation Advocate. Natalie is deeply embedded in the veteran community, having served with a number of veteran support organisations and is also a casual Research Assistant with the Open Door Veteran Research Initiative at Flinders University.

Natalie has also achieved notable academic success and was winner of the Student of the Year award at the Veteran, Emergency Services & Police Industry Institute of Australia (VESPIIA) 2024 Excellence Awards. During 2024, Natalie presented her research at the DVA Women Veterans’ Policy Forum, Scottish International Conference on Armed Forces in Society and also at the Australian Women’s and Gender Studies Association Biannual Conference. She has also been invited to present her research at the UK Centre for Military Women’s Research 2025 conference at Cambridge University.

Natalie has spent over 20 years advocating for veterans and defence personnel. Her motivation stems from a deep commitment to gender equality, diversity, and inclusion. She aims to use her research to inform policies and interventions that improve outcomes for veterans and their families including efforts to end veteran suicide.

After the talk, visitors can stay to explore the Memorial Galleries, embarking on an interactive journey from the First World War to today, before taking time to reflect on the remarkable stories of bravery and sacrifice in the tranquil parklands.

Crafted for the imposing UAP Foundry, Relic explores the interplay of mortality, fragility, youth and spirit. Inspired by the timeless themes of 16th and 17th-century still life paintings and the haunting symbolism of the memento mori movement, Relic reimagines these age-old notions of mortality through the fearless spirit of motocross - helmets for skulls, smoking rubber for snuffed-out candles, and the inevitable heralding of the final lap for the sands in the hourglass.

THIS CONCERT WILL BE AUSLAN INTERPRETED.

The legendary Sir Elton John has provided the soundtrack to the lives of millions around the world. From the glamour of the seventies and the excesses of the eighties, Sir Elton’s music and influence is still felt by today’s generations.

Bringing these fabulous tunes to life is Brisbane’s own piano bar veteran Michael Hynes with ''The Songs of Sir Elton''. Michael and band have a blast showing off the piano thumping energy of hard rocking hits like ‘I’m Still Standing’ and ‘Crocodile Rock’ through to the captivating ballads such as ‘Tiny Dancer’ and the immortal ‘Your Song’.

Brought to you as Sir Elton did in the early seventies as a piano, bass and drums trio, you can’t help but be reminded of the genius of Sir Elton’s song-writing partnership with lyricist Bernie Taupin. These songs will live forever.

A show of war lost and won!

The prophets who once hailed Macbeth, foretelling his rise to power, have lingered in the shadows for too long. Now, the Weird Sisters step out from the wings and take centre stage.

In this reimagining of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Witches—whose cryptic prophecies drive Macbeth to murder, madness, and ruin—become the focus. Their deep spiritual and philosophical connection to the Earth reveals a world groaning under the weight of human ambition. Through their eyes, we see not just Macbeth’s bloody climb to the throne, but the profound consequences of our insatiable desire for power.

In this innovative production, the Weird Sisters are no longer mere bystanders. They embody the forces of nature itself, their voices intertwined with the Earth’s cries for balance and need for healing. Blending dance, movement, text and sound, this hybrid performance explores the interconnectedness of all things—reminding us that every action we take ripples through the natural world.

Co-directed by La Boite Theatre’s Artistic Director Courtney Stewart and Lisa Fa’alafi (Co-Artistic Director Polytoxic, Hot Brown Honey), with a dynamic local cast, this production also welcomes back the formidable Sue Rider, former Artistic Director of La Boite, as dramaturg.

Opening on International Women’s Day, experience a bold new take on one of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies in this daring reimagining of Macbeth.

A show of war lost and won!

The prophets who once hailed Macbeth, foretelling his rise to power, have lingered in the shadows for too long. Now, the Weird Sisters step out from the wings and take centre stage.

In this reimagining of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Witches—whose cryptic prophecies drive Macbeth to murder, madness, and ruin—become the focus. Their deep spiritual and philosophical connection to the Earth reveals a world groaning under the weight of human ambition. Through their eyes, we see not just Macbeth’s bloody climb to the throne, but the profound consequences of our insatiable desire for power.

In this innovative production, the Weird Sisters are no longer mere bystanders. They embody the forces of nature itself, their voices intertwined with the Earth’s cries for balance and need for healing. Blending dance, movement, text and sound, this hybrid performance explores the interconnectedness of all things—reminding us that every action we take ripples through the natural world.

Co-directed by La Boite Theatre’s Artistic Director Courtney Stewart and Lisa Fa’alafi (Co-Artistic Director Polytoxic, Hot Brown Honey), with a dynamic local cast, this production also welcomes back the formidable Sue Rider, former Artistic Director of La Boite, as dramaturg.

Opening on International Women’s Day, experience a bold new take on one of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies in this daring reimagining of Macbeth.
