Bringing compelling new art to Brisbane, the Triennial is a gateway to the rapidly evolving artistic expression of Australia, Asia and the Pacific. Alongside artists and makers whose work has not been previously seen in Australia are a raft of new co-curated projects investigating artforms and cultural contexts rarely encountered outside their home localities.

For the first time this Triennial includes creators from Saudi Arabia, Timor-Leste and Uzbekistan, while First Nations, minority and diaspora cultures hold a central place, as do the collective, performative and community-driven modes of artmaking that thrive in the region. Through nuanced approaches to storytelling, materials and technique the exhibition explores themes that resonate across these cultural landscapes, such as how we care for the natural and urban environments, protect and revive cultural heritage, and how histories of migration and labour shape experience today.

As always, the Triennial is conceived and shaped from the ground up by expert hands. Artists, curators, interlocutors, cultural allies and partners have meaningfully woven the region’s creative stories into an exhibition that will inspire, uplift and move you.

Pink Floyd’s iconic album ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’, originally released in March 1973, turns 50, and what more fitting a place to celebrate it and experience it than in a Planetarium, through the music set to visuals. With the help of modern technology, the idea of a show combining breath-taking views of the solar system and beyond, played out to 42 minutes of The Dark Side Of The Moon in surround sound, has been embraced by the band.

TANGK is the righteous and vibrant fifth album from madcap truth-seekers, IDLES. Pronounced “tank” with a whiff of the “g” - an onomatopoeic reference to the lashing way the band imagined their guitars sounding that has since grown into a sigil for living in love - the record is the band’s most ambitious and striking work yet. Where IDLES were once set on taking the world’s piss, squaring off with strong jaws against the perennially entitled, and exercising personal trauma in real time, they have arrived in this new act to offer the fruits of such perseverance: love, joy, and indeed gratitude for the mere opportunity of existence.

A radical sense of defiant empowerment radiates from TANGK, co-produced by Nigel Godrich, IDLES guitarist Mark Bowen, and Kenny Beats. Despite his reputation as an incendiary post-punk sparkplug, frontman Joe Talbot sings almost all the feelings inside these 10 songs with hard-earned soul, offering each lusty vow or solidarity plea as a bona fide pop song—that is, a thing for everyone to pass around and share, communal anthems intended for overcoming our grievance. Lead single “Dancer” stands as the throbbing and scuzzy highlight at the album’s center - rattling bass and ricocheting guitar giving Talbot space to talk about sweat and sex on the dancefloor. (You will spy LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy and Nancy Whang here, too, singing.) It is lascivious and playful and positive, the ecstatic sound of at least a temporary fix. In the improvised hook, Talbot offers IDLES’ essential new mantra: “I give myself to you/As long as you move on the floor.”

He is singing about the rapture of a new relationship, but he is also singing about the special dynamic between IDLES and their fans, or IDLES and the world at large. This is a band’s vow to keep lifting and fighting for themselves and their listeners, to keep offering the grim persistence of joy and hope and love and wonder as long as that’s what anyone needs to survive. It is a love song the same way that TANGK is a love album—open to anyone who requires something to shout out loud in order to fend off any encroaching sense of the void, now or forever.', 'Brisbane City Council', 'Featured,Music', 'Riverstage, Brisbane City', 'Riverstage, Gardens Point Road, Brisbane City', 'General Council venue', NULL, 'Music', 'Priced ticketed event', 'https://www.trumba.com/i/DgBbax7ELW25KyqaVkZgkX1Z.jpg', 'Suitable for all ages', 'Tickets can be purchased via <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com.au/idles-brisbane-18-01-2025/event/1300606EC3BE3899" target="_blank">Ticketmaster</a>.', TRUE, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Canines have supported soldiers for many years and have been involved in numerous wars. In more modern times, the human knowledge of canines has broadened as soldiers realised that dogs can do a lot more in a battlespace than just point out where the enemy might be hiding and physically attack on command.

Some military working dogs have been bred, trained and combined into the combat capability of a defence force unit and provide ongoing security to air bases, combat units, fighting patrols and surveillance capabilities.

There have been occasions where dogs have provided support to their soldier-boss in areas for which they were never trained and succeeded in literally saving the lives of the human part of their team using canine instinct and on-the-spot behaviour.

This presentation takes you on a journey that includes some history of Australian dog teams at war followed by an insight into some of the research and development of both living canines and robotic ones as well. Be prepared for some surprises and delights along the way.

The presenter, Lieutenant Colonel George Hulse OAM (Retd), has written two books on Australian military working dogs, has spent many years researching canines for military use and was the inaugural commander of the Australian Army Mine Dog Wing at the School of Military Engineering in 1971.

After the talk, visitors can stay to explore the Memorial Galleries, embarking on an interactive journey from the First World War to today, before taking time to reflect on the remarkable stories of bravery and sacrifice in the tranquil parklands.
