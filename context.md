## Events System Enhancements

### Past Events Archive Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive solution for handling past events while maintaining SEO integrity:

1. **URL Structure Preservation**
   - Maintained original URL structure for all events (/events/[slug])
   - Implemented query parameter approach (?archive=true) instead of separate URL paths
   - Ensures all existing links continue to work without redirects

2. **Event Filtering**
   - Modified `getEventsByPage()` function to conditionally include expired events
   - Added `showArchive` parameter to control event filtering
   - Events are sorted by date with ongoing events prioritized

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added a prominent "Past Event Notice" on expired event detail pages
   - Implemented toggle between upcoming and past events on the main events page
   - Created dedicated styling for past event notices with warning colors

4. **Pagination Improvements**
   - Updated pagination to maintain the archive parameter across page navigation
   - Ensured search functionality preserves the archive context

5. **SEO Optimizations**
   - Dynamic page titles and descriptions based on archive context
   - Added appropriate meta tags for both upcoming and past event pages

### CSS Structure Improvements

1. **Dedicated Events Stylesheet**
   - Created `_events.scss` for all event-related styles
   - Properly imported in the component structure
   - Implemented responsive design for event listings

2. **Component Organization**
   - Separated event-specific styles from general components
   - Improved maintainability through modular CSS approach

   - Implemented modern, visually appealing breadcrumb design
   - Added home icon for better visual hierarchy
   - Made breadcrumbs responsive for all device sizes
   - Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
   - Moved breadcrumbs to their own dedicated section between banner and content
   - Aligned breadcrumbs to the left for better readability and consistency
   - Standardized breadcrumb implementation across all detail pages
